# **Azulon - Unity Technical Challenge**

### 🎮 Overview

Create a small Shop + Inventory System in Unity.

The player should be able to:

- View a list of items available for purchase (with name, icon, description, and price)
- Purchase an item
- View the items collected in their personal inventory

---

### 📦 Requirements

- The shop items must be easy to configure and reusable
- The system should be structured in a way that allows different item types or behaviors to be added in the future
- The UI must be clear, functional, and visually pleasant (not necessarily artistic, but well-organized)
- There should be a basic logic to switch between different game states or views (e.g., Shop / Inventory / Purchase feedback)
- Code should be **self-explanatory**: comments are welcome if they clarify edge cases or design decisions, but the goal is that the code itself is clear enough to not require constant explanation.
- Avoid reliance on external frameworks or libraries (e.g., Zenject, third-party packages). The goal is to understand the developer’s thought process rather than their ability to wire external tools
- The project must include at least one gamification mechanic tied to the inventory system (e.g., a creative way to gather currency, or a meaningful use for items in the inventory). It should be clearly integrated into the shop/inventory flow and add an engaging layer beyond the basic functionality.

### 🧠 What We're Evaluating

|        **Skill**            |  **What We Look For**      |
|          ---                |        ---                 |
| Project and Code structure  | Clear separation between logic, data, and presentation |
| Scalability and flexibility | Can new item types or logic be easily added? |
| UI and visual design        | Is the UI intuitive, visually organized, and readable? While aesthetics are not the primary focus, the overall visual appeal will also be taken into account. |
| Code architecture           | Clean, modular design showing understanding of states, data-driven logic, etc. |
| Code readability            | Is the code **self-documenting**, with clear naming and structure that make comments mostly unnecessary? |
| Version Control             | Demonstrates ability to structure commits, write clear messages, and use GitHub professionally |
| Polish and finish           | Does it feel complete? Are there signs of testing, iteration, and care? |
| Gamification                | We’ll evaluate how meaningful the gamification mechanic feels, how well it integrates with the shop/inventory system, and whether it enhances the player’s sense of engagement or progression. Creativity and cohesion with the overall design are key. |
